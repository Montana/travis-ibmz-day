# travis-ibmz-day
Travis CI + IBM Z (IBM Z Day) Project.

The purpose of this project is to show the ease of use and implementation of IBM Z into Travis CI projects.

* Using s390x (Z) 
* Breadth-first search in Python I wrote 
* Depth-first search in Python I wrote 
* Will choose between one or the other, currently I'm building and running the breadth-first search 
* Show the simplicity of implementation on 1 side 
* Show the flexibility via running parallel builds of a BFS & DFS search - both using IBM Z
